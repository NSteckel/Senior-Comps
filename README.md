# Senior-Comps
This is a GitHub repository for documenting my senior comps project and my process of making it. It will include all of my code files, as well as any art, audio or exterior assets and other elements that I am using. 

####
! Note ! While this repo will hold the code files necessary to run my game, they can't be hosted live through GitHub. If you want to run my game, these files must be run in a renpy project, preferably in the 7.4.10 version. This project was built using the 7.4.10 version, but later versions can be used. The current Renpy version can be dowloaded at https://www.renpy.org/latest.html (This will require downloading the renpy-version#-sdk folder, which must then be removed from downloads and placed in your desktop.) You should take the script.rpy file and the 'images' folder provided in this repository and replace the default script.rpy file and images folder that will be automatically created when you make your renpy project.

This project also incorporates other websites outside of the game that must be visited as part of the ARG puzzles. These mini-sites will have their own repositories in order to keep the project as organized as possible.

This is the links to the other repository:
