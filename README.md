# Senior-Comps
This is a GitHub repository for documenting my senior comps project and my process of making it. It will include all of my code files, as well as any art, audio or exterior assets and other elements that I am using. 

####
! Note ! While this repo will hold the code files necessary to run my game, they can't be hosted live through GitHub. If you want to run my game, these files must be run in a renpy project, specifically in the 7.4.4 version. (This will require installing the renpu-7.4.4-sdk folder.) You should take the script.rpy and gui.rpy files provided in this repo and replace the default script.rpy and gui.rpy files that will be automatically created when you make your renpy project. 
--
You will also need to do the same thing with any image or audio files you want to put in the game. Drop the files provided into the images and audio folders (respectively) that are provided in the renpy project.
####

This project also incorporates other websites outside of the game that must be visited as part of the ARG puzzles. These mini-sites will have their own repositories in order to keep the project as organized as possible.

Here are the links to the other repositories:

(there will be one other here, not created yet)
